(1) Assume that a block/tile dimension of 32x32 is used. What is the ratio of
    floating point operations to bytes loaded from global memory performed by
    each of the following kernels? Show your work.

    (a) The kernel implemented in the previous assignment (without shared memory
        tiling)





    (b) The kernel implemented in this assignment (with shared memory tiling)





(2) Assume that a block/tile size of 32x32 is used, and that the program runs
    on a NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU (the model on the HPC cluster) which has the
    following resource constraints:
        > 2048 max threads/SM
        > 32 max blocks/SM
        > 96KB max shared-memory/SM
        > 64K max registers/SM
    Note that you can extract the resource usage of your kernel, including
    registers/thread and shared-memory/block using the folloing command:
                nvcc -c --ptxas-options="-v" kernel.cu
    Answer the following questions about occupancy for the kernel implemented
    in this assignment. Show your work.

    (a) Is occupancy limited by the max blocks/SM?





    (b) Is occupancy limited by the max shared-memory/SM?





    (c) Is occupancy limited by the max registers/SM?
